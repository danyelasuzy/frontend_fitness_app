✨ What We've Built

✅ Motivational Routes

    A selection of routes for users to follow, helping them visualize how far they've walked by comparing it to real-world distances.

✅ User Account System

    Users can:
        Create an account.
        Log in and personalize their profile with an avatar (stored in local storage).

✅ Challenge Features

    Users can:
        Select a challenge.
        Track their progress via a manual input system.
        View their progress on an interactive map layout and challenge progress bar.

✅ Technology Stack

    Frontend: Built with React.js using a mobile-first, responsive design approach.
    Backend: Developed with Node.js and Express, with MongoDB as the database.
    Deployment: Hosted on Heroku for accessibility and ease of use.

🛠️ Our Process

We adopted a modular approach, splitting the project into frontend and backend repositories. This ensures that edits to the codebase are straightforward and maintainable.

Here’s our original Figma design: https://www.figma.com/design/ljfKmAzIri14fPM2iFofv2/PathBuddy?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=S1AwaUMuMgQtirGN-0

🚧 Goals We Didn't Achieve

While we've accomplished a lot, there are a few features that remain unfinished due to time and budget constraints:

❌ Tracking System with Map API

    Initially, we planned to integrate a map API for automated progress tracking, but due to high costs and limited time, we pivoted to a manual input system.

❌ Progress Saving

    Currently, the user's progress is not fully saved in the database. Progress tracking works only while the user remains on the challenge page, and this functionality will need further development.

❌ Social Features

    We envisioned allowing users to:
        Connect with friends.
        Compare progress.
        Compete on a leaderboard.
        Unfortunately, we couldn’t complete this within the timeframe.

❌ Achievement Badges

    A system to reward users with badges (e.g., for completing their first route) is designed but not yet implemented.

🔄 What's Next?

We're proud of what we've built so far, but we recognize there's room for growth. Here's what's on the horizon for PathBuddy:

    🗺️ Automated Progress Tracking using a map API.
    👯 Social Features to connect and compete with friends.
    🏅 Achievement Badges to reward milestones and keep users engaged.

Thank you for checking out PathBuddy! Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome. Let's keep moving! 🚶‍♀️🌍✨
